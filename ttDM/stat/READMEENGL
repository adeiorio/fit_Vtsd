0. Get the combine tool:

   cd CMSSW_7_2_0/src
   cmsenv
   git clone https://github.com/cms-analysis/HiggsAnalysis-CombinedLimit.git HiggsAnalysis/CombinedLimit
   scram b -j 10

1. Get all the histograms in one folder after the merging is complete. The format is always:
   
    ## Process_systematic_channel.root	
   
   All histograms MUST have the same name. The .cpp produces them already in the correct format.


2. edit a "metadatacard" like is explained the following example:

     ## metadatacards_st/data_st_mtwfit_muon.txt

     Note that this datacard has all systematics lines commented,
     if you want to add more make sure that the corresponding histograms are in the
     folder you indicate or it will not work and complain!

3. run under CMSSW_7_3_0
     ## scram b -j 10
     ## analyzeSamples -D myOutputDirectory -d metadatacards_st/data_st_mtwfit_muon.txt
 
    This will automate the datacard production in the directory 
     ## myOutputDirectory/[nameOfSignalSpecifiedInMetaDatacard]/ 
    
    As well as the RooWorkspace in the directory:
    myOutputDirectory/ws/

    workspace_muon.root


4. Maximum likelihood fit with Combine:

   ## combine -M MaxLikelihoodFit testingst/QCDMuEPt20toInf/QCDMuEPt20toInf_shape.txt --saveShapes --saveWithUncertainties --plots
   
   A working example, based on the metadatacard above, is this one:
   ## exampleQCFit.csh   
 
5. Analyze the output of the fit:
   
   The output will be here:
   ## root -l mlfit.root
